Github Recommendation system

1.1 Introduction to Project

 GitHub Recommendation system attempt to predict the preference or rating that a user 
would give to an item. Knowledge discovery techniques can be applied to the problem of making 
personalized recommendations about items or information during a user's connections or 
followers.

Motivation behind project topic

 On the Internet, where the number of choices from technical stack is overwhelming, there is 
need to filter, prioritize and efficiently deliver relevant information in order to alleviate the 
problem of information overload, which has created a potential problem to many Internet users. 
GitHub Recommender systems solve this problem by searching through large volume of 
dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized content and services. This 
project explores the different characteristics and potentials of different prediction techniques in 
recommendation systems in order to serve as a compass for research and practice in the field of 
recommendation systems.

Aim and Objective(s) of the work

Project aim: “The aim of this project is to provide a mechanism to assist users in classifying 
users with similar interests.”

Project objectives 

The objective of a GitHub recommendation system basically is to search for content that would 
be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalized 
lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation 
systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and 
create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results 
are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar 
traits/demographics are working on, and how likely are you to work on those projects. This is 
achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.
